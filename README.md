## Overview

Credit risk modeling is a quantitative analysis technique used by financial institutions, such as banks and credit card companies, to assess and predict the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on their loans or credit obligations. The primary goal of credit risk modeling is to make informed lending decisions and manage the risk associated with extending credit to individuals, businesses, or other entities.
